# Screenshot Notes Maker
A simple python script to take screenshots from a video and save these ss automatically to a folder in a sequence.


## Working
It will ask for two letter one for taking screenshot and one for deleting the last screenshot.
It save the ss with the name which is on the clipboard of your pc at that time with a serial number added to it.

Ex. If you have "Python_class" copied on your clipboard then if you take screenshot using this script it will start saving the ss in this way:
Python_class-1.jpg</br>
Python_class-2.jpg</br>
Python_class-3.jpg</br>
......</br>
To delete the last ss you will press the deleting letter two times and last ss that was taken will be deleted and again if u press then second last and so on.</br>

Run the code for better understanding. :)
